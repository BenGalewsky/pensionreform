index.html loads latest/scripts/bootstrap.js which loads latest.js and
PC/1.7.0./scripts/bootstrap.js.  There are two different bootstrap.js
files, located in different directories.

latest.js sets PC.latestVersion. (This has a random subscript in the
original version, which was removed here.  The random subscript is
most likely used to prevent caching.)

1.7.0/scripts/bootstrap.js creates the object PC and defines utility
functions such as handleException(), addEvent(), asyncLoad(),
setProperties(), etc.  It computes a baseURL (location based off which
other files are loaded).
